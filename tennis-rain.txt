Question 1: If you have to bet on either Bob or Bill for the next match who would you bet on?
-Answer: Bob

Question 2: What is the percentage of the chance that Bill might win the next match?
-Answer: %25

Now, consider further:
To make it more interesting, let us add another factor to the match, which is rain. When Bill won, it was raining. But, when Bob won, out of 3 matches, 1 time it was raining.
By the way, the weather forecast says that there is an extremely high possibility of rain on the day of the next match which is tomorrow. And the forecast is typically very accurate.
Question 3: Do you agree that even without thinking deeply, you can tell that the comparison basis has changed and chances of Bill winning have increased?
-Answer: Possibly, because they both performed equally well under rain.
However, not sufficient data was provided to confidently deny or accept the influence of rain on each player's performance.

Question 4: Who would you bet on as the winner of the next match?
-Answer: Bob

Question 5: What is the percentage of the chance that Bill will win the next match given that it will rain tomorrow?
-Answer: More than %24 and less than %50.
If we ignore clear weather data and rely solely on rainy days' results we can say that they both have equal chance.
Although, they performed the same during rainy days if we consider other information we can safely assume that Bob on average is a better player which leaves Bill with the possibility of winning between 25-49%.
